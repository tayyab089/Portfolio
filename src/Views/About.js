                     Hi! I am Tayyab Qamar who is mainly a front-end developer who can also work on back-end projects and databases. <br /><br />
                     I am a self learned software developer who loves to code <br /><br />
                     Have worked on various self developed and freelance based projects lately<br /><br />
                     Have mainly worked on React and React-Native projects in the recent past and am very keen to develop myself further in the React-Native area.<br /><br />
                     I consider myself a full stack js developer but am mostly focused on front end these days
